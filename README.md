# WPM_Game
A wpm game written in Java.

Each level has a threshold WPM typing speed necessary to pass the level. The first one is 20.0 WPM. After each successful level, the threshold increases until you inevitably lose. How long can you survive?

Uses Java 9.0.4 which can be found here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase9-3934878.html

Download the .jar file from releases to run and play.

I created all assets using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator, and used quotes from https://www.keyhero.com/quotes/?best.
